# Project: Null (Vite + React + Tailwind)

This is the full advanced starter for **Project: Null** â€” an interactive, glitching web ARG experience with a terminal, corruption meter, hidden console lore, and decryptable fragments.

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

2. Run dev server:
```
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production:
```
npm run build
```

4. Deploy to GitHub Pages (requires you to set up a repo named `project-null`):
```
npm run deploy
```

Notes:
- The app base path is set to `/project-null/` in `vite.config.js` for GitHub Pages. Change to `/` if deploying elsewhere.
- Look in the browser developer console for hidden logs and additional clues.
